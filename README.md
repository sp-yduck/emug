# EMug
EMug is a Python package of numerical analysis for ElectroMagnetism

## Description
There are many electromagnetic field simulation tools that use FEM, MoM, FDTD, etc.
On the other hand, what about tools for numerical analysis?
EMug provides you a Python package for electromagnetic field analysis.

## Example
Electromagnetic radiation from infinitesimal electric current element
[example 1 - Electromagnetic radiation from Px dipole](docs\img\emug_example.PNG)
